# VR Social Media Project

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Version  

## **Team Members:**  
- **Front-End Development/Back-End Development:** John M. Pozo  
- **Back-End Development:** Adam  
- **Presentation & Documentation:** Kevin  

## **Overview**  
This project was developed as the final assignment for our **Software Development** course, completed within a **one-week sprint**. The goal was to create an **interactive VR-based website** that simulates a classroom environment while incorporating **social media elements**.  

## **Features & Functionality**  
- **VR Environment:** A portal transports users to a **virtual replica** of our professor’s classroom.  
- **Authentication System:** No registration; users must enter a **predefined email/password** to access the platform.  
- **Classroom Setup:** The VR space includes:  
  - **4 seats with tables, chairs, and monitors**  
  - **A presentation board** displaying lecture slides  
  - **A monitor showcasing social media links**, highlighting the psychology of student interactions through digital platforms  
- **User Interface:** Left panel displays **group information**, while the right panel credits **inspiration and contributors**.  

## **Project Insight & Challenges**  
One key innovation was embedding **presentation slides directly into the VR environment**, ensuring that the project itself became the presentation medium. However, due to time constraints, the slides were integrated into blocks rather than fully interactive components.  

## **Future Improvements**  
Development is ongoing to enhance the **functionality and immersion** of the platform.  

## **Acknowledgments**  
This project was made possible with assistance from **ChatGPT-4o**, helping refine implementation and development strategies.

## **👥 The Squad**  
- **Me:** Front-end/Back-end sorcery 🪄  
- **Kevin:** Presentation Slides 🎤  
- **Adam:** Backend wizard 🖥️  

## **⏳ One Week. No Time to Think.**  
Final project. One week. No sleep. We built a **VR website** with:  
- **A portal that yoinks you into a VR classroom** 📍  
- **A login screen with no sign-ups, just a given email/password** 🔐  
- **A classroom with 4 seats, tables, chairs, monitors, and a presentation board** 🎓  

## **💡 My Galaxy Brain Idea?**  
Professor: *"You’ll present your project in class."*  
Me: *"What if... we put the presentation **inside** the website?"* 🧠💥  

So yeah, I crammed the slides **into the VR world itself**. Didn’t have time to make them fancy, so they ended up as **blocks**, but at least it worked.  

Oh, and I also threw in a **social media monitor** because students practically live on their phones. Felt right.  

## **❌ Time Ran Out, But We Ain’t Done**  
Still cooking up improvements. Expect **better immersion, interactivity, and maybe even fewer bugs.**  

## **⚡ Shoutout to the AI Overlords**  
Wouldn’t have pulled this off without **ChatGPT-4o**. Absolute lifesavers.
